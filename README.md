# Profilarr

Profilarr is a Python-based tool designed to add import/export/sync/delete functionality to the \*arr suite. It offers a user-friendly way to:
- Export existing custom formats / profiles
- Import new custom formats / profiles
- Sync a master instance of Radarr / Sonarr with other instances
- Delete existing custom formats / quality profiles

## ⚠️ Before Continuing

- **This tool will overwrite any custom formats in your \*arr installation that have the same name.**
- **Always back up your Radarr and Sonarr configurations before using Profilarr to avoid unintended data loss.** (Seriously, do it. Even I've lost data to this tool because I forgot to back up my configs.)

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Radarr / Sonarr

### Initial Setup

#### Step 1: Download Profilarr

1. **Download Profilarr:**
   - Go to the Profilarr GitHub page and find the "Releases" [section](https://github.com/santiagosayshey/Profilarr/releases).
   - Download the latest release package.

2. **Extract Files:**
   - Once downloaded, extract the zip file to a folder of your choice.

#### Step 2: Install Profilarr

1. **Open Your Terminal:**
   - **Windows:** Search for `Command Prompt` or `PowerShell` in your start menu.
   - **MacOS:** Search for `Terminal`.
   - **Linux:** Use your desktop environment's application launcher to find `Terminal`, or press `Ctrl+Alt+T` if that's a shortcut in your Linux distro.

2. **Navigate to Profilarr Folder:**
   - Type `cd path/to/your/folder` and press Enter. Replace `path/to/your/folder` with the actual path to where you extracted Profilarr. This command works the same on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Type `pip install -r requirements.txt` and press Enter. This command tells Python to install the necessary software components Profilarr needs to run. The command is the same across all platforms.

4. **Setup Configuration:**
   - Type `python setup.py` and press Enter. This will run a setup script that prepares Profilarr for use by generating a `config.yml` file, essentially Profilarr's settings book.

#### Step 3: Configure Profilarr

1. **Edit `config.yml`:**
   - Open the `config.yml` file in a text editor. Windows users might use Notepad, MacOS users might use TextEdit, and Linux users can use any text editor like Gedit, Nano, or Vim.
   - This file contains different settings that you can adjust to tell Profilarr how to operate.

2. **Add Master Instance Details:**
   - Look for the section related to Radarr/Sonarr.
   - Here, enter the URL and API key for your Radarr/Sonarr instances to link Profilarr with your movie/TV series managers.

3. **Configure Syncing or Exporting (if needed):**
   - **Syncing:** For syncing additional Radarr/Sonarr instances, add their URL, API key, and a name for each.
   - **Exporting:** To set where Profilarr saves files it creates, adjust the `export_path`.
   - **Importing:** If you have settings or lists from other sources, set `import_path` to their location.

4. **Configure ANSI Color Support (Optional):**
   - Profilarr can show colorful text in the terminal. If it's not displaying correctly (like showing `←[94m` instead of colors), you can fix this:
     - In the `settings` section, find `ansi_colors: true`.
     - Change it to `ansi_colors: false`. This disables colorful output for better compatibility with your terminal's capabilities.

5. **Save Your Changes:**
   - After adjusting these settings, save and close the `config.yml` file.

#### You're All Set!

## 🚀 Usage

- If using Windows, use `python <script>` or `py <script>`. If on Linux, use `python3 <script>`.

### Importing

Note: For users who start using Profilarr before v0.3, you no longer need to manually import custom formats. They will be imported automatically. Quality Profiles still require manual selection.

1. If importing Dictionarry files, make sure the import path is `./imports` (This is the default path).
2. If importing non Dictionarry files, make sure the import path is set to your desired import location.
3. Run `python importarr.py` in your command line interface.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to select your desired app and which instance(s) to import to.
5. Choose your desired quality profile(s) to import.

#### Example: Importing 1080p Transparent and 2160p Optimal Quality Profiles

```

### Exporting

1. Make sure the export path is set to your desired export location. The default is `./exports`.
2. Run `python exportarr.py` in your command line interface.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to select your desired app and which instance(s) to export from.
4. Choose the data you want to export.
5. The data will be exported to `exports/{data_type}/{app}/`.

#### Example

```bash
Select your app of choice
1. Radarr
2. Sonarr
Enter your choice:
1
Select your Radarr instance
1. Radarr (Master)

### Syncing

1. Make sure the import path is set to whatever your export path is. This is important, as the script will look for the exported files in this location.
1. Run `python syncarr.py` in your command line interface.
1. The script will automatically export data from the master instance and import it to all other instances specified in `config.json`.

#### Example

```bash
PS Z:\Profilarr> py syncarr.py
Select your app of choice
1. Radarr
2. Sonarr
Enter your choice:

### Radarr and Sonarr Compatibility

- You are only able to import / sync files to the app that is included in the file name (e.g. `Radarr` or `Sonarr`).
- It is possible to manually rename the files to import them to the other app, but this is not recommended.
  - Custom Formats will succesfully import, but will require manual editing to work with the other app, i.e. you must adjust the quality sources to match the other app's naming scheme.
  - Quality Profiles will not import at all, as they are not compatible with the other app. It is possible to import them manually by editing the json directly, but this is not recommended.
  - In future, I may add a feature to automatically convert profiles between the two apps, but this is not currently a priority.

## 🌟 Upcoming Features

- **Lidarr Support:** Expand functionality to include Lidarr, allowing users to manage music quality profiles and custom formats.
- **User Interface (UI):** Development of a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier and more intuitive interaction with Profilarr. This UI will cater to users who prefer graphical over command-line interactions.
- **Automatic Updates:** Implement an auto-update mechanism for Profilarr, ensuring users always have access to the latest features, improvements, and bug fixes without manual intervention.

## Contributing

- I've added a docker compose file for testing custom formats / quality profiles. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the Radarr/ Sonarr test containers. Add your API keys to the `config.yml` file and begin testing!

# TRaSH Guides

Some custom formats found here have been interated on from the trash guides. Credit for these goes entirely to trash, and can be found on their site here. It is not my intention to steal their work, but rather to build on it and make it more accessible to the average user through my quality profiles. Please check out their site for more information on their work.
